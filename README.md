# About
The Intention Timer app seeks to provide a chronometer to help the user to organize, achieve and keep track of their goals. With this app the user has the ability to set a study, meditation, or exercise goal and add a custom description of what they'd like to accomplish during the timeframe they set.



 ## Technologies Used

   - JavaScript
   - HTML
   - CSS

# Instructions
1. When the user first loads the app, they have to select one of the three categories to work on it.
2. After a category is selected, the user has to write a description about what they'd like to accomplish during the timeframe they set.
3. The user must specify in the section of minutes and seconds the time that they would like to work, after that they are ready to start the activity.
4. In the next window they can verify if the information is correct, and get ready to start the timer.
5. When the user completes the activity, they would have the option to log it and keep track of their progress.
6. Finally they can start a new activity and timer by clicking the *CREATE A NEW ACTIVITY* button.
