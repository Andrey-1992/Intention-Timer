## Iteration 0 - Zero State
- [x] Build out a PR Template
- [x] Wireframe Iteration 0
- [x] Build the layout with HTML & CSS
    - [x] Before moving on, the header and left side of the page should match the comp.
    - [x] The right side of the page should only have the sub-header and note that no activities exist since you do not have past activity card functionality yet!


## Iteration 1 - Activity Class
### üõë  STOP! Did you refactor Iteration 0? Clean up your code before moving on! üõë 
- [x] Build out the Activity class
  - [x] Properties should include:
      - [x] category
      - [x] description
      - [x] minutes
      - [x] seconds
      - [x] completed
      - [x] id

  - [x] Methods should include:
    - [x] countdown (or beginTimer or startTimer - whatever naming makes sense to you)
    - [x] markComplete
    - [x] saveToStorage
  
  - [x] Make sure that you link this file in your index.html using a script tag, above the link to your main.js file.


## Iteration 2 - Form Functionality
### üõë  STOP! Did you refactor Iteration 1? Clean up your code before moving on! üõë 
- [x] Form Functionality
  - [x] When an activity category is clicked on (`Exercise`, `Meditate`, or `Study`), the associated border and icon should change colors to give a visual indication that it has been selected. _Colors are provided in comp._
  - [x] An input field should be provided for `What would you like to accomplish during this time?`, `minutes` and `seconds`. The `minutes` and `seconds` fields should only accept numbers. (Hint: more than one layer should probably be put into place to ensure this. Make sure that e cannot be accepted.)
  - [x] A user should see an error message if they attempt to submit the form without filling out all fields. (Note: The comp shows the error message for forgetting a description - You should mimic this error messaging for all inputs.)
  - [x] A `Start Activity` button is provided to submit the data entered into the form. When the button is clicked, update your data model with an instance of the Activity class.
  - [ ] When the `Start Activity` button is clicked, the user should no longer see the form, and instead see a timer clock. The timer clock should display the user-provided minutes and seconds, as well as the description. The category should not appear, but the outline of the circle should match the color associated with the category.
  - [ ] If the `Start Activity` button is clicked before the user has entered information into all four inputs, the user will receive an error message, but will not lose any information that was provided.

## Iteration 3 - Build an MVP
### üõë  STOP! Iteration 3 - Build an MVP üõë 
- [ ] Wireframe Iteration 3
- [ ] The user can start the time by clicking Start.
- [ ] While timer is running, the user should see it count down by second.
- [ ] When the timer completes, an `alert` should appear in the browser, letting the user know that the time is up and the activity has been completed.
- [ ] NOTE: This [alert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) is temporary and is not something we suggest using in a fully built out application.

## Iteration 4 - Logging Past Activities
### üõë  STOP! Did you refactor Iteration 3? Clean up your code before moving on! üõë 
- [ ] Wireframe Iteration 4
- [ ] When the timer completes, the `alert` no longer appears.
- [ ] Instead, a motivational or congratulatory message appears on the left side of the page, replacing the timer.
- [ ] When the user acknowledges the message and completion of the activity by clicking `Log Activity` - 
    - [ ] A card with the `category`, `time`, and the users input for `What would you like to accomplish during this time?` should appear. 
    - [ ] The card should also have a small color-coded visual indicator of the category. Color, size, and spacing of that visual indicator are provided in comp.
- [ ] Before moving on, your past activity cards should match the comp.

## Iteration 5 - Persisting past activities
### üõë  STOP! Did you refactor Iteration 4? Clean up your code before moving on! üõë 
- [ ] Wireframe Iteration 5
- [ ] When the user refreshes the page,
    - [ ] Their past activities are still displayed!
    - [ ] Hint: localStorage could come in handy here‚Ä¶

# Optional Extensions
### Remember, do not move on to any of these extensions if functionality from the previous iterations is not complete or bug-free.
- [ ] **Option 1:** Expand/Collapse Reflection
    - [ ] Wireframe Option 1
    - [ ] When timer completes but before a card is created, the user can submit a reflection on the way they spent that time. Then, they can click the Log
    - [ ] Activity button to create the card.
    - [ ] Even though there is more information about the activity, the reflection should not appear on the card immediately. The cards should still match the comp. The user should have a visual indicator that there is ‚Äúmore info‚Äù on a card. When the user takes the appropriate action, the card expands to show the reflection the user had submitted.
    - [ ] The user should also have a way to collapse the additional information/reflection.
- [ ] **Option 2:** Favorite & Re-Do
    - [ ] Wireframe Option 2
    - [ ] A user should be able to favorite or re-do an activity.
    - [ ] A favorite icon should be on the card. When clicked, the icon should change its appearance to communicate it has been favorited.
    - [ ] An icon to represent re-do should also be on the card. It should only be enabled when the left side of the page is displaying the New Activity form. If the re-do button is clicked, the form will populate with the data from the card that was clicked on.
- [ ] **Option 3:** Pausing the Timer
    - [ ] Wireframe Option 3
    - [ ] After the timer begins, a user should be able to pause the timer and resume an activity when they wish
- [ ] **Option 4:** Animate the Timer
    - [ ] Wireframe Option 1
    - [ ] Animate the border around the timer in a way that communicates how much time is left.

**Consider the user experience:** the actions a user needs to take should be intuitive for someone who has never seen this application before. [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) contains great resources and articles, but their homepage also has some great examples of classy animations and hover states that convey something to the user.

Before moving on to an extension, the site should match the comp and any additions should be in the spirit of the comp and have been user-tested from a great user experience (UX).

# Comp Details

### Colors
- [ ] Main background: #2B2733
- [ ] Text on main background: #CBC9CF
- [ ] Header, cards: #46424D
- [ ] Card shadow: #26222D
- [ ] Text on header and cards: #FFF
- [ ] Study: #B3FD78
- [ ] Meditate: #C278FD
- [ ] Exercise: #FD8078
- [ ] Error: #EFB7EC

### Icons
- [ ] Active (color-coded) and non-active (white) icons are all stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EpDeH6IeDTOaK3fP9YR_XkaB4mwCWZxm). You will need to download and save these in an assets directory in your project.

### Fonts
[Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/?query=mont&selection.family=Montserrat:300,400), both 300 and 400 weights are used in the comp. You‚Äôll need to link this in the HTML.


# Rubric
This rubric should serve as a guide for students as they progress through the project, as well as to self-evaluate. Instructors will use it to evaluate the project at its final due date/time, and provide detailed feedback so students know what areas to focus on in future projects.

Scores land in a range between 1 and 4. Below is a breakdown of what those numbers represent.

- [ ] **4 (exceptional)** - went beyond set learning goals; did self-teaching to go above and beyond in this area
- [ ] **3 (proficient)** - exactly on track! you‚Äôre where you need to be in this area! great work!
- [ ] **2 (trailing)** - a little behind where we want to see you right now; in a good place to build familiarity/competency in this area; study in this area to level up and grow
- [ ] **1 (dragging)** - significantly behind where we want to see you; major growth needs to be shown in this area; set up a pairing session with an instructor as soon as possible
To earn a given score, an application must meet the requirements listed in that score explanation and all scores lower.

## Professionalism
### 4:
- [ ] Team uses a PR template for every pull request
- [ ] Team habitually conducts thorough code reviews in the GitHub GUI to document the progress of the application
- [ ] Team has sought out technical code reviews from one or more mentors and documented them in the GitHub GUI
### 3:

- [ ] Commit messages are consistent, descriptive, and concise and begin with a verb and capital letter
- [ ] Team uses PRs to screen/verify code before adding it to the main branch
- [ ] Branches are consistently used for individual features
- [ ] There is no more than a 10% disparity in project contributions between teammates
- [ ] README is well formatted and gives good context about the project, including links to both contributors‚Äô GitHub profiles, and to the deployed GitHub Pages site
### 2:
- Commits are large and do not effectively communicate the progression of the application
- Team uses PRs but do not review code before merging into the main branch
- Branches are sometimes used for individual features
- There is a 20% disparity in project contributions between teammates
- README is brief and does not provide context for the project
### 1:
- Some commits are pushed directly to the main branch
- PRs are used inconsistently
- There is a 50% disparity in project contributions between teammates
- There is no README, or the ‚Äúboilerplate‚Äù README is left in the project.

## Comp Recreation
### 4:
- [ ] Additional elements and animations have been added that match the visuals established in the comps, and/or design is responsive across small, medium and large breakpoints.
### 3:
- [ ] Application implements all major comp details accurately and correctly on desktop (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment, etc).
- [ ] If additional elements were added, they generally match the visuals established in the comps, but may be slightly awkward.
- [ ] Careful attention was given to the little details like spacing, alignment, and hover states.
### 2:
- Application implements most major comp details accurately and correctly (colors, fonts, icons, spacing, alignment, etc.).
### 1:
- Application has a significant mismatch when compared to the provided comp.

## HTML && CSS - Style and Implementation
### 4:
- [ ] Developers use [BEM](http://getbem.com/), [SMACCS](http://smacss.com/), or another set of naming conventions for classes. Note: If going this route, let assigned instructor know which naming convention will be used.
- [x] Application fully implements HTML that is accessible for individuals with visual disabilities. Note: This will be checked using the Chrome Extenstion [WAVE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/wave-evaluation-tool/jbbplnpkjmmeebjpijfedlgcdilocofh?hl=en-US) audit tool, and 0 errors & 0 contrast errors are expected. To get this extension to work with local files, follow these steps:
   - [x] Install
   - [x] Right click the WAVE extension
   - [x] Click ‚ÄúManage Extensions‚Äù
   - [x] Flip the ‚ÄúAllow access to file URLs‚Äù switch
   - [x] Success!
### 3:
- [ ] Application utilizes consistant naming for HTML classes and IDs, and follows suggested conventions. Example: classes should be named using kabab-case, ids should be used sparingly.
- [ ] CSS is DRY, utilizing existing classes/rules to cut down on repetitive styles. There is evidence of reused styles in the application.
### 2:
- Application uses an appropriate amount of [HTML semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure). Semantic elements like `<button>`, `<li>`, etc. are used instead of `<div>`. If `<div>` elements are used, they are only for styling purposes.
- Application utilizes organizational conventions for the whole CSS stylesheet. This may look like - grouping native elements, typography styles, layout styles, etc. together.
### 1:
- Crafts CSS according to the [Turing CSS style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/css)
- Crafts markup according to the [Turing HTML style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/html)

## JavaScript - Style and Implementation
### 4:
- [ ] All functions strictly adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- [ ] There are no nested if/else statements
- [ ] Functions and code are well-refactored and show developer empathy
### 3:
- [ ] Application uses the Data Model exclusively to track changes to the activities, and display of activities happens after the Data Model has been updated
- [ ] There are no nested for loops
- [ ] Functions are DRY and observe SRP - and most are around 10 lines of code or less
- [ ] There are no global variables aside from query selectors, an array for your activities and a currentActivity variable (if needed).
- [ ] Uses event delegation correctly on dynamic elements where applicable
- [ ] Uses parameters and arguments to craft short and reusable functions. There are no parameters or arguments in functions that are unused.
### 2:
- Data model is built to the specifications detailed in the spec sheet and is fully separated from the DOM. Example: There should not be any DOM manipulation in class files. - example: there is no DOM logic in the Activity class.
- All console logs, debuggers and comments are removed from code before submitting.
### 1:
- Crafts JS according to the [Turing JS style guide](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/javascript/tree/master/es5)

## Functional Expectations
Functionality is the least important piece of the rubric. It‚Äôs included because it is another benchmark to gauge proficiency (for example, we can‚Äôt grade your JS if there isn‚Äôt enough of it written!). However, you should not pursue functionality at the expense of code quality or the learning/growth of all team members.

This means, we DO NOT want to see:

- [ ] Code that completes iterations but is sloppy
- [ ] One or both team members do not understand every single line of code
- [ ] One or both team members skips the problem solving process (pseudocoding, talking out the problem, articulating, planning) in the pursuit of completing functionality
**- [ ] A score cannot be earned if all developers are not intimately familiar with the concepts and understanding driving every line of code.**

- 4: Application completes an extension without bugs.
- 3: Application meets all of the expectations of Iteration 5 without bugs.
- 2: Application meets all of the expectations of Iteration 4 without bugs.
- 1: Application meets all of the expectations of Iteration 3 without bugs.
